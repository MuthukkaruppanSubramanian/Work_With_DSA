	/*
		You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing
		 the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of 
		 the stones you have are also jewels.
		
		Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
	 * 
	 * 1) Did I understand the problem? Yes or No !! - Yes 
	 * -> If No, Ask the person to provide more detail with example(s) 
	 * -> If yes, go to next step !!
	 * 
	 * What is the input(s)? - Strings
	 * What is the expected output? - String
	 * Do I have constraints to solve the problem? - No
	 * Do I have all informations to go to next step!!
	 * How big is your test data set will be?
	 * 
	 *
	 * 3) Do I know how to solver it?
	 *	Yes - great, Is there any alternate solution?
	 *	No - Can I break down the problem to sub problems?
	 *
	 * 4) Ask for the hint (If you don't know how to solve it)
	 *
	 *
	 * 5) Do I know alternate solution to solve this problem? - yes
	 *	Yes - What are those? Yes
	 *	No ï¿½ That is still fine, proceed to solve by what you know !!
	 *  Simple Technique - > Brute Force !!
	 *  
	 * 6) If you know alternate solutions -> find out the O Notations (Performance)
	 *  Approach 1: Hashing
	 *  
	 * 8)Implement the code
	 * 
	 * 9)Test against the different data set
	 * 
	 * 10) If it fails Debug them to solve it !!
