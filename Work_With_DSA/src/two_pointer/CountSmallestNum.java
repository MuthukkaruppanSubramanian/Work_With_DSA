	 *

	 * // TODO Auto-generated method stub
	 * 
	 * 1) Did I understand the problem? Yes or No !! - Yes 
	 * -> If No, Ask the person to provide more detail with example(s) 
	 * -> If yes, go to next step !!
	 * 
	 * What is the input(s)? - String
	 * What is the expected output? - String
	 * Do I have constraints to solve the problem? - No
	 * Do I have all informations to go to next step!!
	 * How big is your test data set will be?
	 *
	 *
	 * 2) Test Data Set
	 *  Minimum of 3 data set !! 
	 *  Positive : 
	 *   
	 *  Edge     : 
	 *  
	 *  Negative : 
	 *  Validate the data set with the interviewer 
	 *
	 * 3) Do I know how to solver it?
	 *	Yes - great, Is there any alternate solution?
	 *	No - Can I break down the problem to sub problems?
	 *
	 * 4) Ask for the hint (If you don't know how to solve it)
	 *
	 *
	 * 5) Do I know alternate solution to solve this problem? - yes
	 *	Yes - What are those?
	 *	No – That is still fine, proceed to solve by what you know !!
	 *  Simple Technique - > Brute Force !!
	 *  
	 * 6) If you know alternate solutions -> find out the O Notations (Performance)
		 *	Then, explain either both or the best (depends on the time)
	 *	Approach 1: Start with worst -> Improve (Optimize) -> End up with the best
	 *
	 * 7) Start with Pseudo code
	 * 		a. Sort the give array
	 * 		b. Traverse the array in while loop until left <=right
	 * 		c. If
	 * 		d. 
	 * 		e. 
	 * 		f. 
	 * 		
	 * 8)Implement the code
	 * 
	 * 9)Test against the different data set
	 * 
	 * 10) If it fails Debug them to solve it !!
